Dr. Malone has extensive research and development experience in the areas of clinical trials, vaccines, gene therapy, bio-defense, and immunology.  He has over twenty years of management and leadership experience in the academia, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  His FDA, HHS, and DoD agency knowledge is extensive.  Dr. Malone is an internationally recognized scientist and is known as one of the original inventors of “DNA Vaccination.”  Dr. Malone holds numerous fundamental domestic and foreign patents in the fields of gene delivery, delivery formulations, and vaccines.  He has over fifty peer-reviewed publications, has been an invited speaker at over thirty-five conferences, has chaired numerous conferences and he has sat on numerous study sections.  Dr. Malone is in the Harvard Medical School Global Clinical Scholars Program in 2015-2016.  \n\nIn August 2014, colleagues at the Department of Defense/Defense Threat Reduction Agency asked Dr. Malone to step in and help NewLink manage the Ebola project and develop the contracts necessary to move the \"orphan\" PHAC/rVSV ZEBOV vaccine forward quickly.  Dr. Malone got the project on track, recruited our client Focus Clinical Trials to team with USAMRIID/WRAIR to develop the immunoassays, put WHO leadership in touch with Pentagon leadership to expedite the initial WRAIR clinical trials, recruited the government of Norway to help fund the clinical research, used social media (LinkedIn) to recruit Merck Vaccines to join the project, recruited a management team, and lead the development of the BARDA and DTRA contracts - yielding over 200M$ in resources.  Those were frightening times, but now we have a remarkably effective vaccine, developed in record time.\n\nDr. Malone was CEO and co-founder of RW Malone MD, LLC, a very successful consulting and development firm focused on clinical trials and USG medical countermeasure proposal capture and management.  As a capture and proposal manager, Dr. Malone has an extraordinary funding record.  In the past five years, he has been involved in ten billion dollars of successful government contracts and awards.  A link to the PDF list of those awards, as well as details of his role in capturing those awards can be found below.\n\n",

                  "bio": "Robert W. Malone, M.D., M.Sci.  CEO, CSO,  co-founder and board of manager member of Atheric Pharmaceutical, LLC. Dr. Malone has extensive research and development experience in the areas of clinical trials, vaccines, gene therapy, bio-defense, and immunology.  He has over twenty years of management and leadership experience in the academia, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  His FDA, HHS, and DoD agency knowledge is extensive.  Dr. Malone is an internationally recognized scientist and is known as one of the original inventors of “DNA Vaccination.”  Dr. Malone holds numerous fundamental domestic and foreign patents in the fields of gene delivery, delivery formulations, and vaccines.  He has over fifty peer-reviewed publications, has been an invited speaker at over thirty-five conferences, has chaired numerous conferences and he has sat on numerous study sections.  Dr. Malone is in the Harvard Medical School Global Clinical Scholars Program in 2015-2016.  \n\nIn August 2014, colleagues at the Department of Defense/Defense Threat Reduction Agency asked Dr. Malone to step in and help NewLink manage the Ebola project and develop the contracts necessary to move the \"orphan\" PHAC/rVSV ZEBOV vaccine forward quickly.  Dr. Malone got the project on track, recruited our client Focus Clinical Trials to team with USAMRIID/WRAIR to develop the immunoassays, put WHO leadership in touch with Pentagon leadership to expedite the initial WRAIR clinical trials, recruited the government of Norway to help fund the clinical research, used social media (LinkedIn) to recruit Merck Vaccines to join the project, recruited a management team, and lead the development of the BARDA and DTRA contracts - yielding over 200M$ in resources.  Those were frightening times, but now we have a remarkably effective vaccine, developed in record time.\n\nDr. Malone was CEO and co-founder of RW Malone MD, LLC, a very successful consulting and development firm focused on clinical trials and USG medical countermeasure proposal capture and management.  As a capture and proposal manager, Dr. Malone has an extraordinary funding record.  In the past five years, he has been involved in ten billion dollars of successful government contracts and awards.  A link to the PDF list of those awards, as well as details of his role in capturing those awards can be found below.\n\n",
