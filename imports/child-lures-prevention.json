This was the first federal legislative effort to regulate child pornography and provide funding for survivors of child sexual abuse and exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing college, Rosemary co-founded Child Lures Prevention with her father, Ken Wooden and sister, Jennifer Mitchell in Shelburne, Vermont. Together, they created the Think First & Stay Safe School Program, based on Ken Woodenâ€™s groundbreaking interviews with hundreds of convicted child molesters and the familyâ€™s subsequent work in countless classrooms across the country. Rosemary also co-authored the program's Parent Guide and Student Workbook, which are widely used, both with the school program and independently.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turn-key Think First & Stay Safe™ School Program was the sole prevention program featured at the most recent White House Conference on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children. It is currently used in thousands of schools and faith-based organizations, as well as by child advocacy centers, youth groups and other child-serving organizations. Rosemary collaborates with these groups, as well as with countless survivors, to bring primary prevention efforts to their communities.

Together, they created the Think First & Stay Safe School Program, based on Ken Woodenâ€™s groundbreaking interviews with hundreds of convicted child molesters and the familyâ€™s subsequent work in countless classrooms across the country. Rosemary also co-authored the program's Parent Guide and Student Workbook, which are widely used, both with the school program and independently.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turn-key Think First & Stay Safe™ School Program was the sole prevention program featured at the most recent White House Conference on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children. It is currently used in thousands of schools and faith-based organizations, as well as by child advocacy centers, youth groups and other child-serving organizations.

Jennifer collaborates with these groups, as well as countless survivors, to bring primary prevention efforts to their communities. She oversees annual program research, updates and revisions.
