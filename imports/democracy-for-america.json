Joe Lieberman, Sen. Blanche Lincoln, and Rep. Al Wynn.  He also directed DFA's successful campaigns to stop the Republican War on Working Families in Wisconsin and Ohio.  In January of 2012, Charles became the Executive Director of Progressive Congress, the foundation for the Congressional Progressive Caucus.  Charles rejoined DFA as Executive Director in August of 2013 and leads the strategic direction of the DFA team.\r\n\r\nBefore DFA, Charles spent over a decade grassroots organizing and directing statewide campaigns in 17 states for direct democracy initiatives and referendums working with the AFL-CIO, SEIU, Americans for Medical Rights, and others in fights ranging from funding early childhood development and protecting civil liberties to defending collective bargaining rights and raising the minimum wage.  He's also served on staff for Assemblymember Scott Wildman in California's 43rd as the community organizer responsible for revitalizing in-district resident associations, neighborhood watches, and PTA's.\r\n\r\nOutside of the office, Charles likes to play disc golf, drink micro-brews, and eat Vermont cheese at the Farmhouse as well as watch too much T.V. with his wife, Alejandra and dog, Quazar.",
