It would be great if the workshops were an opportunity to brainstorm with the various coaches, mentors, and sponsors about what resources exist in Vermont that could help your business. For TheaterEngine, I found most relevant resources on my own afterwards. Business Consultants, Digital Marketing Consultants, Vermont Technical Alliance, etc. I never felt like I got to know the other mentors or sponsors very well. That being said, the relationship LaunchVT provided with the mentors assigned to me were worth their weight in gold. ","Mentorship, Peer Network, Pitch Prep, Networking",I get a lot of warnings about the necessity to leave Vermont once TheaterEngine is profitable because of the taxes.
