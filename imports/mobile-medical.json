      "description": "MMIC is a diverse company offering both commercial and military/disaster readiness product lines for domestic and international markets.  Founded in 1994 by Rick Cochran, MMIC was based on an identified need for mobile surgical services.  Through the introduction of the first Mobile Surgery Unit™ (MSU™) in 1996 to the U.S. Air Force at Lackland Air Force Base’s Wilford Hall Medical Center, it was determined a more rapidly deployable, tactically mobile design would provide the first combat-ready shelter systems capable of providing “equivalency of care” to soldiers around the world.",
