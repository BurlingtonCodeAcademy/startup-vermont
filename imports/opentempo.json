He then worked as an independent consultant and software developer, creating custom applications and delivering software development tools. After a 9-month hiatus when Travis traveled across the globe, he returned to the corporate world as Manager of Customer System Management at IDX/GE Healthcare, where he worked extensively in the field of radiology imaging. He eventually rejoined with Rich and started OpenTempo in 2006.\r\n\r\nTravis has a BA in computer science from Boston University. He loves rock climbing and has written a very comprehensive book on climbing in Vermont (Tough Schist). Travis is prized at OpenTempo for his ability to keep 1,000 balls in the air – even as someone throws in a chainsaw.",
