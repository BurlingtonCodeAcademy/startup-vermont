He determined to address this issue by creating a way to fund these needed services. Unfortunately, the state was largely unwilling or unable to appropriate funds, so he took matters into his own hands.\r\n\r\nUsing RMH as his base of operations, he banded together with other mental health professionals, interested legislators at the state and local level and private citizens and companies who wanted to help. Their collaboration resulted in the creation of a non-profit organization founded as a limited liability corporation. This corporation then raised funds to pay for the needed medical services.\r\n\r\nToday, mental health services in Vermont are better than ever, thanks to the hard work of these dedicated people.
