      "description": "THINKMD develops next generation clinical assessment and data analytics platforms that transform point-of-care medicine by putting medically validated clinical assessment capability into\r\nthe hands of non-healthcare professionals. This technology allows for the decentralization of healthcare delivery into communities and homes by pairing clinical knowledge and Bayesian/pattern recognition algorithms with simple to use mobile technology. Our goal is to reinvent the healthcare delivery paradigm, reduce costs, and improve outcomes by improving healthcare access and care-seeking behavior, while building a public health knowledge database.",
