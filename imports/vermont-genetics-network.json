      "description": "The Vermont Genetics Network (VGN) is funded by a five-year, $16.5 million award from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), and is part of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative called IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE). Under the direction of Dr. Judith Van Houten, the VGN, which links scientists at Castleton State College, Johnson State College, Middlebury College, Norwich University and St. Michael's College to resources at UVM, is designed to provide funding for research, equipment and technology necessary to enhance competitiveness for national funding for genetics research. Other aims of the project include increasing the number of undergraduates who go on to biomedical careers from the baccalaureate colleges, to provide and support bioinformatics capability in the state, and to increase the diversity of biomedical scientists.",
