      "description": "Vote Hemp is a national, single-issue, nonprofit organization dedicated to the acceptance of and free market for industrial hemp, low-THC oilseed and fiber varieties of Cannabis, and to changes in current law to allow U.S. farmers to grow the crop. Their ultimate goal is having hemp grown on a commercial scale in the U.S. once again and for the crop to be able to be processed here as well. They educate people on the issues surrounding hemp, register voters, and build coalitions to fulfill their mission.\r\n\r\nVote Hemp is working to shift federal regulation of industrial hemp farming out of the hands of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and get hemp farming regulated on the state level.\r\n\r\nVote Hemp also works to defend against any new laws, regulations or policies that would prohibit or restrict hemp commerce or imports.",
